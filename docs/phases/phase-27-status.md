# Phase 27 – Risk Framework

## Status
FRAMEWORK NOT IMPLEMENTED

## Verified Existing Artifacts
The repository contains risk-related configuration fields and metrics.
These include:
- Risk-related config schema elements
- Risk-related metric fields
- Tests referencing risk-related values

These artifacts DO NOT constitute a standalone Risk Framework.

## Not Verified
No standalone, phase-scoped Risk Framework module,
engine component, or enforcement layer was verified.

## Acceptance Boundary
Phase 27 can only be marked as implemented if:
- A standalone framework-level artifact exists
- Repository-verifiable module(s) define risk policy logic
- Documentation and tests explicitly map to Phase 27 framework scope

## Explicit Declaration
As of this document revision, Phase 27 Risk Framework
is NOT implemented as a standalone framework artifact.

Existing risk-related metrics/config fields must not be
interpreted as framework-level completion.

This declaration removes ambiguity between metrics and framework.
